  <h2>You know I can paint the world
    Sitting there in black and gold
    You're the perfect chemical
    I gotta test I gotta know
    You know I'm no criminal
    But I could take your heart and go
    You're the perfect chemical
    I gotta test I gotta gotta
    Just let me
    좋은 차 많은 돈
    없을 수 있어 하지만
    난 널 아낄 수 있고
    또 소중히 다룰 수 있어
    그리고 네가 원하면
    우주선을 타 밤하늘
    건너 별을 따 너의
    손에 쥐여줄 수 있어
    말만 해 뭐든지 뭐 어때?
    비 오는 날 커피? okay
    신사 홍대 압구? okay
    아침에 no make up?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      It's okay it's okay

Sitting on top of the world just cue
Missing a puzzle I swear it's you
You know I can paint the world
Sitting there in black and gold
You're the perfect chemical
I gotta test I gotta know
You know I'm no criminal
But I could take you heart and go
You're the perfect chemical
